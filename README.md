# Laser-Beams
Fourth Assignment of the semester for CSC344
This Assignment required us to build a grid of 10x12. The user enters a position of the laser on the y-index, and
a list of obstacles (position and size). The program then provides a list of locations to place mirrors and reflect
the laser around the person (avoiding objects).
